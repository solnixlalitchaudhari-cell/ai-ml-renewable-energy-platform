# ☀️ AI/ML Renewable Energy Platform
## Scalable Power Forecasting & Intelligence for Solar & Wind Operations

Renewable energy generation is inherently volatile, dictated by fluctuating weather patterns and hardware efficiency. This platform provides a production-ready AI framework designed to mitigate this variability through high-accuracy power forecasting and scalable MLOps practices.

Developed as part of an **AI/ML Research Internship**, this project bridges the gap between experimental data science and industrial deployment.

## 🚀 Key Features (Phase 1)

* **Multi-Model Forecasting:** Implementation of both Gradient Boosting (**XGBoost**) and Deep Learning (**LSTM**) architectures to capture both tabular features and temporal dependencies.
* **Production-Grade API:** Real-time inference engine built with **FastAPI**, designed for low-latency integration with energy management systems.
* **Engineering Rigor:** Built-in model versioning, feature consistency checks, and a structured retraining strategy to handle data drift.
* **Performance Benchmarking:** Comparative evaluation using **MAE** and **RMSE** to ensure the most reliable model is deployed.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Languages & Core:** Python, NumPy, Pandas
* **Machine Learning:** XGBoost, Scikit-learn
* **Deep Learning:** TensorFlow/Keras (LSTM)
* **Deployment:** FastAPI, Uvicorn
