AI/ML Renewable Energy Platform

An industry-oriented AI/ML platform for solar and wind energy operations, focused on accurate power forecasting and scalable renewable intelligence.

This project was developed as part of an AI/ML research internship using real-world engineering and MLOps practices.

Overview

Renewable energy generation is highly variable due to weather and operational conditions. This project addresses that challenge by building a production-ready AI system to predict solar power generation and support data-driven decision making.

The current phase implements the power forecasting module, which serves as the foundation for future expansion.

Current Features (Phase 1)

Power Forecasting – Predicts AC power output of a solar plant

Model Comparison – XGBoost vs LSTM, evaluated using MAE & RMSE

Production Readiness – Model versioning, feature consistency, retraining strategy

API Deployment – Real-time inference using FastAPI

Tech Stack

Python, XGBoost, LSTM, FastAPI, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
